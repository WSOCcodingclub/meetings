Track weekly meetings

This should be used to track club meetings.  For now just add notes here.  Later maybe break things up into one document per meeting.

# 2018

## Jan 8 Meeting

First day back after Christmas Break.  The meeting is on for those who can make it.

### Code Editors

* Emacs via [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/develop/layers/%2Bdistributions/spacemacs-docker)

* Vi via vim

* Microsoft [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).  Alternate Docker setup [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/jess/vscode/) but that's to complicated.

### What's a for loop for?

Go over a for loop.  Try to sort something. [Tutorial link](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_introduction/#loops).  Python [docs link](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement)

## Jan 22 Meeting

First day back after yet another break!

* Make sure laptops all have VSCode (see link above)
* Make sure laptops are all running Docker, etc etc, and have the sample project loaded (https://github.com/WSOCcodingclub/django_docker)
* load up the simple for loop program from last time ([Tutorial link](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_introduction/#loops)).

### Sorting a list

Today we're going to sort that list of names that we displayed in the old program.  This will teach lots of small but important aspects of programming, including `if` statements, temporary variables, looping, and so on.

1. copy the file `Python_intro.py` to a new file called `sorting_list.py`
2. open up `sorting_list.py` in the VSCode editor
3. collaborate on sorting that list of names (alphabetically):
    girls = ['Rachel', 'Monica', 'Phoebe', 'Ola', 'You']
    
Think about how you would alphabetically sort that list in your head.  Try to write down exactly what your brain is doing.  That is an algorithm.  We'll turn that algorithm into code, and then see how well it does.
